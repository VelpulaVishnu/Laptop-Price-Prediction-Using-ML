# Laptop Price Prediction Using ML
The main goal of this project is to predict the **price of laptops** based on their specifications. By analyzing various features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, display, and GPU, we aim to develop a model that accurately estimates the price of any given laptop configuration. This helps consumers, sellers, and manufacturers make data-driven pricing decisions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding
This step focuses on gaining insights into the structure and content of the dataset.
It involves identifying:
- The total number of records and features
- Data types (numerical, categorical)
- Presence of missing values or inconsistencies
- Relationships between input features and the target variable (price)

The goal is to understand the context and significance of each feature before processing.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration
In this step, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover trends and patterns.
We visualize data using histograms, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps to identify:
- Feature distributions
- Outliers and anomalies
- Relationships between specifications and laptop prices
- Which features have the most influence on the target variable

This helps guide feature selection and preprocessing decisions.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensionality Reduction
When multiple features are correlated or redundant, dimensionality reduction techniques help simplify the dataset.
This improves model performance and reduces overfitting.
Techniques such as **Correlation Analysis** or **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** are used to retain the most important features
while removing irrelevant or duplicate information.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing ensures that the dataset is clean and ready for model training.
This step includes:
- Handling missing values and incorrect entries
- Encoding categorical variables into numeric form
- Normalizing and scaling numeric features
- Detecting and treating outliers

The goal is to make the data consistent, standardized, and suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new, meaningful features from the existing data to improve model accuracy.
For example:
- Extracting processor brand (Intel, AMD, Apple) from the CPU column
- Combining storage types (HDD + SSD)
- Categorizing screen size or resolution
- Deriving interaction terms between key specifications

Good feature engineering directly impacts the model‚Äôs predictive power.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building and Evaluation
In this stage, various regression models are trained to predict laptop prices.
Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Support vector Regressor
- KNN Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGB

Each model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

The model with the best performance (in this case, **Random Forest Regressor**) is chosen as the final model.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Prediction
Once the final model is trained and saved, it can be integrated into a real-world application.
Users can input laptop specifications (like brand, RAM, GPU, etc.) and get instant price predictions.
This feature enables interactive, real-time estimation and helps validate the model‚Äôs effectiveness outside the training environment.
